The plan:
-You have to fend off waves of zombies (the storm)
-Every few waves, you change area
-There is perma-upgrades you can buy with currency.
-Before each run, you have a perma-upgrade segment. (the calm)

### I made the decision to scrap this due to time constraints ###
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Before each run, you also have a timed preparation segment. This might be scrapped.
The better you do in the timed segment, the more powerful you are in your run.
Each time you do the timed segment, you get better because of either experience (winning minigames) or solving puzzles.
