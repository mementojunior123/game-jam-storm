The plan:
-You have to fend off waves of zombies (the storm)
-Every few waves, you change area
-Before each run, you have a perma-upgrade segment and a timed preparation segment (the calm). The timed preparation segment may be scrapped. 
The better you do in the timed segment, the more powerful you are in your run.
Each time you do the timed segment, you get better because of either experience (winning minigames) or solving puzzles.
-There is perma-upgrades you can buy with currency.
