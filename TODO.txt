The plan:
-You have to fend off waves of zombies (the storm)
-Every few waves, you change area
-Before each run, you have a timed preparation segment (the calm). 
The better you do in this segment, the more powerful you are in your run.
Each time you do the preparation, you get better because of either experience, solving puzzles, or perma-upgrades.
