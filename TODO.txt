The plan:
-You have to fend off waves of zombies (the storm)
-Every few waves, you change area
-Before each run, you have a timed preparation segment (the calm). 
The better you do in this segment, the more powerful you are in your run.
Each time you do the preparation, you get better because of either experience, solving puzzles, or perma-upgrades.

Priority list
-----Necessary-----
-Add a token based perma-upgrade system.
-Figure out what the prep section is going to be. (Maybe scrapped)
-Figure out enemy spawning. (In progress)
-------High--------
-Implement some sort of weapon system. (In progress)
-Find assets for backgrounds, the player, zombies and bullets. 
-Figure out transition between areas. 
------Medium-------

-Some sort of auto-aim. 
-------Low---------
-Implement settings. 
-Mobile support.
